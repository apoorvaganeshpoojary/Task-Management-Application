INTRODUCTION:
A mini project on a Task Management System focuses on creating a simple tool that helps
users organize, prioritize, and track tasks efficiently. It enables task creation, assignment,
and status tracking with features like setting priorities, deadlines, and reminders. The
system aims to improve productivity by offering a user-friendly interface for individuals
or teams to manage their tasks effectively, whether working on a personal project or
collaborating with others. The project can be developed using web technologies and
serves as a practical solution for managing workloads and deadlines.
